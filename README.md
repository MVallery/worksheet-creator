# Infinite Math Worksheets 
A web application that generates math worksheets based on user input selections. Includes 16 customizable concepts including all basic operations with whole numbers, decimals, and fractions, input output tables, order of operations, area, and perimeter. 

React-pdf library is used to compile the math problems into a pdf document the user can then download. 

Node, Express, and MongoDB was used to build user authentication which allows users to store previous worksheet data in order to regenerate similar worksheets. 

# Motivation
While working as an educator I was often unhappy with the quality of resources provided by the schools or online. I needed more ability to customize the work for my students so I built 
this application to help me to do that. It was also important to include more difficult to find concepts such as input output tables with decimals or ensuring that decimal
problems were not already set up for students.
